# PassCrack
Okay! So this is an open source project made by 
Chexmate45#5265

Description:

When calling the file, you test if the password you entered with
the file will be the same password inside of a text document

example: I want to check if the password 'Mars123' is inside some random
password list document

---------
Usage of python file:

python main.py (password you want crack)

example: python main.py lol321

IMPORTANT WONT WORK UNLESS YOU DO THIS

BEFORE you run the program, inside of the password text file you
want to use, copy all of the content in there and paste it inside list.txt

If you have any trouble, please message my discord account, which is yes at the top.
